			There will be multiple projects spread across diverse fields and different complexities. On every launch day, an exciting project will be launched and there will be a LIVE discussion session on the WnCC discord server to get you acquainted with the basics needed and the possible contributions to the repository. Then for the rest of October, we have regular chit-chat and discussions over Discord and make contributions because Coders Together Strong! :))<br/><br/>

Contributing to these repos not only gets you started but also brings you participation in Hacktoberfest since all of these repos are under the hacktoberfest tag. All the projects have mentors allotted to help you out if you feel stuck or clueless at any point. Wishing you all the best for starting your journey towards Open Source.
