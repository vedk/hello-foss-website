HelloFOSS was started last year, on the lines of HacktoberFest and GSoC.
It provides many with their first opportunity to develop Software as a community. 

This Year's theme is Social Good.
We have projects in Flutter, Bash, Machine Learning, Data Structures, Algorithms, Simulation and much more!

We also have exciting opportunities waiting for those who make an impact with their work!
